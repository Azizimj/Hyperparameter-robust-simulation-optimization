Your home directory is full. Most likely it's from your python packages being saved to ~/.local. If that's the case, we recommend that you use a "symbolic link" to link the .local directory to somewhere in your project directory . That way you consume your project quota instead of your home directory quota.

This is how you would do it:


cd ~

mkdir /home/rcf-proj/ma3/azizim/python_packages
mv .local .local_backup

ln -s /home/rcf-proj/ma/azizim/python_packages .local

# If this was successful you should be able to type ls -la and see an arrow pointing from .local to /home/rcf-proj/ma3/azizim/python_packages

cp -r .local_backup .local

# delete old .local_backup

rm -r .local_backup

You can check your quota with myquota and then retry the installation.
